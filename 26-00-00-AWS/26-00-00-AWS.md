# Integration Energy Logserver with AWS service

## The scope of integration

The integration of Energy Logserver with the AWS cloud environment was prepared based on the following requirements:
1.	General information of the EC2 area, i.e .: 
   - number of machines 
   - number of CPUs 
   - amount of RAM 
2.	General information of the RDS area, i.e. 
   - Number of RDS instances 
   - The number of RDS CPUs 
   - Amount of RDS RAM 
3. EC2 area information containing information for each machine i.e .: 
   - list of tags; 
   - cloud Watch alarms configured 
   - basic information (e.g. imageID, reservtionid, accountid, launch date, private and public address, last backup, etc.) 
   - list of available metrics in cloud watch 
   - a list of snapshots 
   - AMI list 
   - cloud trail (last 100 records, with detailed details)
4. Information on Backups of EC2 and RDS instances
5. Search for S3 objects, shoes, AMI images
6. Downloading additional information about other resources, ie IG, NAT Gateway, Transit Gateway.
7. Monitoring changes in the infrastructure based on Cloudtrail logs;
8. Monitoring costs based on billing and usage reports.
9. Monitoring the Security Group and resources connected to them and resources not connected to the Security Group
10. Monitoring user activity and inactivity.
11. Integration supports service for multiple member accounts in AWS organization

The integration uses a Data Collector, i.e. the Energy Logserver host, which is responsible for receiving data from external sources.

## Data download mechanism

The integration was prepared based on AWS (CLI), a unified tool for managing AWS services, with which it is possible to download and monitor many AWS services from the command line. The AWS (CLI) tool is controlled by the Energy Logserver data collector, which execute commands at specified intervals and captures the results of data received from the AWS service. The obtained data is processed and enriched and, as a result, saved to the Energy Logserver indexes.

## AWS Cost & Usage Report

The integration of Energy Logserver with the AWS billing environment requires access to AWS Cost & Usage reports, which generated in accordance with the agreed schedule constitute the basic source of data for cost analysis in Energy Logserver. The generated report is stored on S3 in the bucket defined for this purpose and cyclically downloaded from it by the Energy Logserver collector. After the report is downloaded, it is processed and saved to a dedicated Elasticsearch index. The configuration of generating and saving a report to S3 is described in the AWS documentation:  https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-and-usage-reporting/.

## Cloud Trail

The integration of the Energy Logserver with the AWS environment in order to receive events from the AWS environment requires access to the S3 bucket, on which the so-called AWS Trails. The operation of the Energy Logserver collector is based on periodical checking of the "cloudtraillogs" bucket and downloading new events from it. After the events are retrieved, they are processed so that the date the event occurred matches the date the document was indexed.
The AWS Trail creation configuration is described in the AWS documentation:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html#creating-a-trail-in-the-console. 

## System operation procedures

### Configuration of access to the AWS account

Configuration of access to AWS is in the configuration file of the AWS service (CLI), which was placed in the home directory of the Logstash user:

```
/home/logstash/.aws/config
 [default]
aws_access_key_id=A************************4
aws_secret_access_key=*******************************************u

```
The "default" section contains aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key.
Configuration file containing the list of AWS accounts that are included in the integration:

`/etc/logstash/lists/account.txt`

## Configuration of AWS profiles

AWS profiles allow you to navigate to different AWS accounts using the defined AWS role  for example : "EnergyLogReadOnly". Profiles are defined in the configuration file:

`/home/logstash/.aws/config`

```
Profile configuration example:
[profile 111111111222]
role_arn = arn: aws: iam :: 111111111222: role / EnergyLogReadOnly
source_profile = default
region = eu-west-1
output = json
```

The above section includes
- profile name;
- role_arn - definition of the account and the role assigned to the account;
- source_profile - definition of the source profile;
- region - AWS region;
- output - the default format of the output data.

### Configure S3 buckets scanning

The configuration of scanning buckets and S3 objects for the "s3" dashboard was placed in the following configuration files:
- /etc/logstash/lists/bucket_s3.txt - configuration of buckets that are included in the scan;
- /etc/logstash/lists/account_s3.txt - configuration of accounts that are included in the scan;

### Configuration of AWS Cost & Usage reports

Downloading AWS Cost & Usage reports is done using the script:
"/etc/logstash/lists/bin/aws_get_billing.sh"

In which the following parameters should be set:
- BUCKET = bucket_bame - bucket containing packed rarpotes;
- PROFILE = profile_name - a profile authorized to download reports from the bucket.

## Logstash Pipelines

Integration mechanisms are managed by the Logstash process, which is responsible for executing scripts, querying AWS, receiving data, reading data from files, processing the received data and enriching it and, as a result, submitting it to the Energy Logserver index. These processes were set up under the following Logstash pipelines:

```
- pipeline.id: aws
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/aws/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awstrails
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awstrails/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awss3
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awss3/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awsbilling
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awsbilling/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1 
```

## Configuration of AWS permissions and access

To enable the correct implementation of the integration assumptions in the configuration of the IAM area, an EnergyLogserver-ReadOnly account was created with programming access with the following policies assigned:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "backup:Describe*",
                "backup:Get*",
                "backup:List*",
                "cloudwatch:Describe*",
                "cloudwatch:Get*",
                "cloudwatch:List*",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "iam:GenerateCredentialReport",
                "iam:GetCredentialReport",
                "logs:Describe*",
                "logs:Get*",
                "rds:Describe*",
                "rds:List*",
                "tag:Get*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowSpecificS3ForEnergyLogServer",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::veoliaplcloudtraillogs",
                "arn:aws:s3:::veoliaplcloudtraillogs/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
