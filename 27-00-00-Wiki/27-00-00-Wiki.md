### Creating a public site

There are several ways to create a public site:

- by clicking the **New Page** icon on the existing page;
- by clicking on a link of a non-existent site;
- by entering the path in the browser's address bar to a non-existent site;
- by duplicating an existing site;

1. Create a site by clicking the **New Page** icon on an existing page

   - On the opened page, click the **New Page** button in the menu at the top of the opened website:

     ![](/media/media/image169.png)

     

   - A new page location selection window will appear, where in the **Virtual Folders** panel you can select where the new page will be saved. 

   - In the text field at the bottom of the window, the **new-page** string is entered by default, specifying the address of the page being created:

     ![](/media/media/image170.png)

     

   - After clicking on the ***SELECT*** button at the bottom of the window, a window will appear with the option to select the editor type of the newly created site:

### Creating a site with the permissions of a given group

To create sites with the permissions of a given group, do the following:

4. Then create the site in the path, putting the name of the group to which the user belongs. In this case it will be putting your site in the path starting with ***/demo***(preceded by an abbreviation of the language name):

   ![](/media/media/image198.png)

   

5. Click the ***SELECT*** button at the bottom of the window, a new window will appear with the option to select the editor type for the newly created site:

   ![](/media/media/image200.png)

   

7. After completing the site with content, save it by clicking the ***Create*** button in the menu at the top of the new site editor

   ![](/media/media/image201.png)

### Create a "tree" of documents

***Wiki.js*** does not offer a document tree structure directly. Creating a structure (tree) of documents is done automatically by grouping sites according to the paths in which they are available.

1. To create document structures (trees), create sites with the following paths:

   ```markdown
   /en/linux/1-introduction
   /en/linux/2-installation
   /en/linux/3-configuration
   /en/linux/4-administration
   /en/linux/5-summary
   ```

2. The items in the menu are sorted alphabetically, so the site titles should begin with a number followed by a dot followed by the name of the site, for example:

   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/1-introduction*** you should set the title ***1.Introduction***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/2-installation*** you should set the title ***2.Installation***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/3-configuration*** you should set the title ***3.Configuration***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/4-administration*** you should set the title ***4.Administration***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/5-summary*** you should set the title ***5.Summary***

3. In this way, you can create a structure (tree) of documents relating to one topic:

   ![](/media/media/image193.png)

   

4. You can create a document with chapters in a similar way. To do this, create sites with the following paths:

   ```wiki
   /en/elaboration/1-introduction
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/3-summary
   ```

5. The menu items are in alphabetical order. Site titles should begin with a number followed by a period followed by a name that identifies the site's content:

   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/1-introduction*** you should set the title ***1. Introduction***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-1*** you should set the title ***2. Chapter 1***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-2*** you should set the title ***2. Chapter 2***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-3*** the title should be set to ***2. Chapter 3***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/3-summary*** you should set the title ***3. Summary***

6. In this way, you can create a structure (tree) of documents related to one document:

   ![](/media/media/image194.png)
